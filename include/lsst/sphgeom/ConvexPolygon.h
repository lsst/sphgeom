/// `ConvexPolygon` is a closed convex polygon on the unit sphere. Its edges
/// are great circles (geodesics), and the shorter of the two great circle
/// segments between any two points on the polygon boundary is contained in
/// the polygon.
///
/// The vertices of a convex polygon are distinct and have counter-clockwise
/// orientation when viewed from outside the unit sphere. No three consecutive
/// vertices are coplanar and edges do not intersect except at vertices.
///
/// Furthermore, if a convex polygon contains a point p of S², then we require
/// that it be disjoint from point -p. This guarantees the existence of a
/// unique shortest great circle segment between any 2 points contained in the
/// polygon, but means e.g. that hemispheres and lunes cannot be represented
/// by convex polygons.
///
/// Currently, the only way to construct a convex polygon is to compute the
/// convex hull of a point set.
