/// `Region` is a minimal interface for 2-dimensional regions on the unit
/// sphere. It provides three core pieces of functionality:
///
/// - It allows a region to be approximated with a simpler one.
/// - It allows for inexact (but conservative) computation of the spatial
///   relationships between two regions.
/// - It provides transformation between objects and binary strings.
///
/// Given a pixelization of the unit sphere with pixels that can be
/// bounded by Regions, this provides all the necessary functionality for
/// determining which pixels may intersect a Region.
///
/// When implementing a new concrete region subclass R, the Region interface
/// should be extended with:
///
///     virtual Relationship relate(R const &) const = 0;
///
/// All other Region subclasses must then implement this method. In
/// addition, R is expected to contain the following implementation of the
/// generic relate method:
///
///     virtual Relationship relate(Region const & r) const {
///         return invert(r.relate(*this));
///     }
///
/// where invert is defined in Relationship.h.
///
/// Given two Region references r1 and r2 of type R1 and R2, the net effect
/// is that r1.relate(r2) will end up calling R2::relate(R1 const &). In other
/// words, the call is polymorphic in the types of both r1 and r2.
///
/// One negative consequence of this design is that one cannot implement new
/// Region types outside of this library.
